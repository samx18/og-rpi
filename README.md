This open guide is still very much work in progress and is bascially a brain dump from my personal experiences with the raspberry pi.

### [Create a raspberry pi bootable sd card](#create-a-raspberry-pi-bootable-sd-card)

Create a bootable SD card image for raspberry pi

**Get the raspbian image**

Download the official Raspbian image from

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Due to limited bandwidth at the offical site it is recommended to use torrents rather than doing a direct download.

A good cross platform torrent client is transmission https://transmissionbt.com/


**Discover your card (Optional)**

Once you have attached the card to your laptop, you might need to find it if it does not show up automatically. Most windows and mac users may not need to do the below steps

`df -h`  or `fdisk -l`

**Unmount your card (Optional)**

`sudo umount /dev/sdd1`

**Copy the image**

Make sure to use the whole device name like sdd and not partion name like sdd1

`dd bs=4M if=2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/sdd conv=fsync`

If you face issuse with 4M try 1M

**GUI programs**

You can also use GUI programs like etcher to automatically format and copy the image to your SD card.

### Finding the RPi on your network

If you want to quickly discover the IP address of your raspberry pi. This obviously will work only if you are on the same network as your rasppberry pi.

```
% arp -na | grep -i b8:27:eb
? (192.168.1.89) at b8:27:eb:1a:bd:ca on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (192.168.1.92) at b8:27:eb:62:6e:4 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
```

## Troubleshooting

## Projects

### [Pi Hole](#pi-hole)

**Installation**

You can do a simple direct install  

`curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`

However always excercise caution when running bash scripts. If you prefer download, review and install locally

`https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole#alternative-semi-automated-install-methods`

Once installed, use the IP address of your pi where you installed pi hole as your DNS server in your router.

Note some ISPs may not allow the DNS address to be updated, in which case you may have to manually update DNS settings for each device

**Web Console**

The installer will optionally install a lighthttpd server and a web admin console. You can access. Make sure to note the password for the web console at the end of the installation.

The console can be accessed via port 80

`http://youripaddress/admin`

**Password reset**

In case you forget you admin password, you can simply reset it by

`pihole -a -p`

**Blocklists**

Add Additional block lists

You can get additional block lists from the fireblog site

`https://firebog.net/`

You may need to tweak the lists as you may need to unblock specific sites

Lists can be added manually to the file

`/etc/pihole/adlists.list`

You can also add lists via the pihole admin console


**Update block lists**

`pihole -g`

**PADD**

PADD provides in-depth information about your Pi-hole. Setup PADD

Get the script

`wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpmck/PADD/master/padd.sh`

Set permissions

`sudo chmod +x padd.sh`

Run manually

`./padd.sh`

Run automatically at startup

```
# Run PADD
# If weâ€™re on the PiTFT screen (ssh is xterm)
if [ "$TERM" == "linux" ] ; then
  while :
  do
    ./padd.sh
    sleep 1
  done
fi
```
